            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>2016 heralds beginning of the "megatall" skyscraper era</h1><p>The number of skyscrapers over 600 metres high - known as "megatalls" - is set to more than double in the next few years, say experts. Skyscraper authority the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) has revealed that the number of 600-metre-plus buildings in the world is set to rise from three to seven in the next five years.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6162d7ae66c7c63eb63d77e497ca469c/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.dezeen.com%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F01%2FThe-Kingdom-Tower_Adrian-Smith_Gordon-Gill-Architecture-_dezeen_social.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>
